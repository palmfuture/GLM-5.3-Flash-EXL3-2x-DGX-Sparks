"""Align prefill chunks to the Mamba block, not to the smallest cache block.

``Scheduler._mamba_block_aligned_split`` keeps the "align" cache-mode
invariant -- slot p holds the SSM state after exactly (p + 1) * block_size
tokens, written at chunk ends, so chunk ends must be block aligned -- using
``cache_config.block_size``. The engine recomputes that value as the minimum
block size over the prefix-caching groups (engine core), which the DFlash
drafter group drags down to its own page while the Mamba groups keep their
block. Chunk ends then land off the Mamba block:

* the state block hashed at the next chunk end holds the running state of an
  unaligned chunk end, so a prefix hit on it resumes the SSM layers short of
  the attention prefix (the align kernel writes one running-state slot per
  request, never intermediate boundary states);
* a boundary crossed mid-chunk gets no state block at all, so the checkpoint
  is lost and a repeat backs up one Mamba block.

The split also backs ``last_cache_position`` off by one block whenever
speculative decoding is EAGLE-like, assuming full attention drops its last
matching block. With patch_hybrid_prefix_hit.py only the drafter group is
EAGLE-flagged and full attention keeps every block, so the back-off only
discards the last reachable checkpoint.

This patch derives the alignment from the Mamba groups' own block size and
applies the back-off only when the full-attention group (group 0) is among
the coordinator's EAGLE groups. Sub-block progress is unchanged: an
allowance smaller than the Mamba block still advances inside a block and
stops at the next boundary. With a budget of two blocks minus the draft
slots (7168 - 8 against 3584) the aligned chunk is one block.

Requires patch_scheduler_decode_floor.py v5 (or an unpatched scheduler):
v5 bounds the alignment's ``max_prefill_tokens`` by the per-request mixed
cap, so a capped request keeps sub-block progress instead of rounding to
zero; earlier decode-floor forms are rejected. No shared anchors with that
overlay, either application order yields the same file.

Usage:
    python3 patch_mamba_align_chunking.py

Idempotent; a partially applied or drifted source fails before writing.
